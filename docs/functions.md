# Funtions


In PostgreSQL, a function is a named and parameterized SQL routine that encapsulates a sequence of SQL and procedural statements. Functions can be used to perform specific tasks, calculations, or operations, and they can return a value or a table.

While stored procedures and functions in PostgreSQL share similarities, they serve slightly different purposes and have some key distinctions:

1. **Stored Procedures:**
   - Procedures in PostgreSQL are typically used for procedural programming and can perform a series of SQL and procedural language statements.
   - They are defined using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement.
   - Procedures can have input and output parameters, but they do `not necessarily return a value`.
   - Execution of a procedure is usually done with the `CALL` statement.

   Example of a stored procedure:

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE my_procedure(param1 INT, param2 VARCHAR)
   LANGUAGE plpgsql
   AS $$
   BEGIN
     -- Procedure logic...
   END;
   $$;
   ```

2. **Functions:**
   - Functions, on the other hand, are used to encapsulate and return a single value or a table.
   - They are defined using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement.
   - Functions can have input parameters and may return a value using the `RETURNS` clause.
   - Execution of a function is typically done by calling it in an SQL query.

   Example of a function:

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION my_function(param1 INT, param2 VARCHAR)
   RETURNS INT  -- Example of a function returning an integer
   LANGUAGE plpgsql
   AS $$
   BEGIN
     -- Function logic...
     RETURN 42; -- Example return statement
   END;
   $$;
   ```

In summary, while both stored procedures and functions allow you to define custom routines in PostgreSQL, procedures are often used for procedural logic without necessarily returning a value, while functions are designed to return a value. The choice between using a procedure or a function depends on the specific requirements of your application and the nature of the task you are performing.


# Naming Conventional
When naming functions in PostgreSQL, it's essential to choose clear and descriptive names that convey the purpose and functionality of the function. Here are some common conventions and recommendations for naming functions in PostgreSQL:

1. **Descriptive Names:**
   - Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose or action performed by the function.
   - Choose names that clearly convey the expected behavior or outcome.

2. **Underscores or CamelCase:**
   - Use underscores (`_`) or CamelCase for multi-word function names.
   - Consistency is key; choose one style and stick to it throughout your database.

3. **Prefixes:**
   - Consider adding prefixes to indicate the type of function:
     - `fn_`: Prefix for general functions.
     - `sp_`: Prefix for stored procedures.
     - `udf_`: Prefix for user-defined functions.

4. **Avoid Ambiguity:**
   - Avoid generic or ambiguous names. Be specific about what the function does.
   - Include information about input parameters if it helps in understanding the purpose.

5. **Follow Table/Entity Names:**
   - If the function operates on a specific table or entity, consider including the table/entity name in the function name.
   - Example: `calculate_employee_salary` or `get_customer_details`.

6. **Use Consistent Naming Patterns:**
   - If you have a set of related functions, consider using a consistent naming pattern for better organization.
   - Example: `calculate_salary`, `validate_salary`, `update_salary`.

7. **Avoid Reserved Words:**
   - Avoid using PostgreSQL reserved words as function names.
   - Check the PostgreSQL documentation for a list of reserved words.

8. **CamelCase vs. Underscores:**
   - Choose between CamelCase (`calculateSalary`) and underscores (`calculate_salary`) based on your team's preferences or existing conventions.

9. **Clarity Over Conciseness:**
   - Prioritize clarity over extreme conciseness. It's more important to have a name that is easy to understand.

Examples:

```sql
-- Using underscores
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_salary(employee_id INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Function logic
END;
$$;

-- Using CamelCase
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculateSalary(employeeId INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Function logic
END;
$$;
```

Choose a convention that aligns with your team's preferences or follows any existing conventions in your organization. Consistency is key to maintaining a clear and manageable codebase.
