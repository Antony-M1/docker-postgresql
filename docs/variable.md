# Variable

In PostgreSQL, you can declare and use variables using the `DECLARE` statement in the context of a block. PostgreSQL supports `PL/pgSQL`, which is a procedural language similar to `PL/SQL` in Oracle. Here's an example of how you can declare and use a variable in PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Example of declaring and using a variable in PL/pgSQL block
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    my_variable INT;
BEGIN
    -- Assign a value to the variable
    my_variable := 42;

    -- Use the variable in a query
    RAISE NOTICE 'The value of my_variable is %', my_variable;

    -- You can perform other operations using the variable
    -- For example, increment the variable
    my_variable := my_variable + 1;

    -- Use the updated variable value
    RAISE NOTICE 'After incrementing, the value of my_variable is %', my_variable;
END $$;
```

In the above example:

- `DECLARE` is used to declare a variable named `my_variable` of type `INT`.
- The `BEGIN` and `END` block contains the code where you can use the declared variable.
- The `:=` operator is used for assignment.
- The `RAISE NOTICE` statement is used to print messages to the console, including the value of the variable.

Note: The example uses the `DO` statement to execute an anonymous block. In a stored procedure or function, you would declare variables within the `DECLARE` section at the beginning of the block.
